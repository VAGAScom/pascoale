# Pascoale

Minor utilities for text processing in Brazilian Portuguese.

I'm going to add new functions as I need them. Currently it has only variations of a word at one and two **edit distances** (Reference: http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).

The code is kinda slow, but I'm not worried about speed (yet).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pascoale'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pascoale

## Usage

Variations of a word (typos and misspelling)

```ruby
require 'pascoale'

edits = Pascoale.Edits.new('vocÃª')

# 1 edit distance
puts edits.editions.inspect

# 2 edits distance
puts edits.editions2.inspect # LOTS of output, be aware.
```
